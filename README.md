# xeus-pygame-extensions
Framework aiming at making 2D games with PyGame easier and faster.

PyGame is a great tool for many tasks and goals. Its basic purpose is to create 2D video games, but we can also use it in all the projects that require 2D graphics or support for easy sound management. However, the library itself is quite low level, what is considered rather an advantage, but when we have written a lot of projects using PyGame, and we want to make another one, to check 
something out or to create a prototype just to save our new idea, there is a lot of code we have to write over and over again.

Xeus Pygame Extensions project aims at delivering a set of classes and utitilies that will shorten the time required to achieve such goals.
